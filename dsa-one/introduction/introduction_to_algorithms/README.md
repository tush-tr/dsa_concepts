# Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms
### <b>Data Structures--</b><br>
Arrangement of data so that they (data items) can be used efficiently in memory.
<br>

### <b>Algorithms--</b><br> 
Sqeuence of steps on data using efficient data structures to solve a given problem.

### Other Terminologies:<br>
<b>Database –</b><br>
Collection of information in permanent storage for faster retrieval and updating.<br>

<b>Data warehouse –</b><br>
Management of huge data of legacy data for better analysis.<br>

<b>Big data –</b><br> Analysis of too large or complex data, which cannot be dealt with the traditional data processing applications. 

### Memory Layout of C Programs:
When the program starts, its code is copied to the main memory. <br><br>
Stack holds the memory occupied by functions. <br><br>
Heap contains the data which is requested by the program as dynamic memory.<br><br>
Initialized and uninitialized data segments hold initialized and uninitialized global variables respectively.
